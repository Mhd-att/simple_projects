# 🚀 Odd Numbers Summation Project

> This project is a solution to a problem solved in **4 different ways** to understand the concept of repetition better. It calculates the sum of odd numbers up to a user-entered value.

**Example:** $N = 5$ → $(5, 3, 1)$ → **Sum = 9**

### 🧠 The 4 Solutions

* **1️⃣ Algorithm #1:** Standard loop with `if (n % 2 == 1)`.
* **2️⃣ Algorithm #2:** Optimized jump using `n -= 2`.
* **3️⃣  Algorithm #3:** Another method similar to the previous solution But longer.
* **4️⃣ Algorithm #4:** Mathematical shortcut using `(n / 2)**2`.
